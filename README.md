# github-actions-quickstart

I appreciated how this guide walked me through each individual step of the processâ€”the explanations and directions were clear, concise, and easy to follow. I had no issues creating my repository and following the steps outlined. That being said, I think the intro section is a little too dense/heavily technical, making it kinda difficult to understand. A lot of the content of the hyperlinks also went over my head. Further explanation of runners and concepts such as CI and code scanning (mentioned in the intro) would also be helpful.
